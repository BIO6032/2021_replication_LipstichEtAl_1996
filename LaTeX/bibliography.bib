    abstract = {The most crucial stage in the dynamics of virus infections is
    the mode of virus transmission. In general, transmission of viruses can
    occur through two pathways: horizontal and vertical transmission. In
    horizontal transmission, viruses are transmitted among individuals of the
    same generation, while vertical transmission occurs from mothers to their
    offspring. Because of its highly organized social structure and crowded
    population density, the honey bee colony represents a risky environment for
    the spread of disease infection. Like other plant and animal viruses, bee
    viruses use different survival strategies, including utilization of both
    horizontal and vertical routes, to transmit and maintain levels in a host
    population. In this review, we explore the current knowledge about the
    honey bee viruses and transmission routes of bee viruses. In addition,
    different transmission strategies on the persistence and dynamics of
    host–pathogen interactions are also discussed.}

    abstract = {Theory suggests that the evolution of parasite virulence is
    linked to the dynamics of parasite transmission. All else being equal,
    parasites transmitted vertically from parents to offspring should be less
    virulent than parasites capable of horizontal transmission to unrelated
    hosts. This is because the fitness of vertically transmitted parasites is
    tightly linked to the reproductive success of the host, whereas the fitness
    of horizontally transmitted parasites is relatively independent of host
    reproduction. The virulence-transmission relation has seldom been tested
    because of difficulties inherent in comparing virulences of different
    parasite-host systems. We compared the virulence of lice and mites infesting
    a single group of captive rock doves (Columba livia). Lice, which were
    vertically transmitted, had no detectable effect on host fitness, whereas
    horizontally transmitted mites drove host reproductive success to zero.
    These results, in conjunction with a survey of the literature, support the
    hypothesis that ectoparasite virulence is linked to the mode of
    transmission.}

    abstract = {Vertical and horizontal transmission are terms that describe
    the transfer of symbionts from parents to offspring and among unrelated
    hosts, respectively. Many symbionts, including parasites, pathogens,
    mutualists, and microbiota, use a combination of both strategies, known as
    mixed-mode transmission (MMT). Here I review what is known about the
    evolution, ecology, and epidemiology of symbionts with MMT and compare MMT
    with our expectations for single-mode strategies. Symbionts with MMT are
    common and, in comparison with single-mode symbionts, show many surprising
    features. MMT combines the best of two worlds with regard to the ecological
    conditions required for persistence and plays a role in the evolution of
    virulence and genome architecture. Even rare transmission by the minority
    type of these two transmission modes can make a big difference for the
    system. This review explores the conceptual issues surrounding the dynamics
    of mixed-mode symbionts by reviewing literature from the entire range of
    host and symbiont taxa.}

    abstract = {The idea that vertical transmission of parasites selects for
    lower virulence is widely accepted. However, little theoretical work has
    considered the evolution of virulence for parasites with mixed horizontal
    plus vertical transmission. Many human, animal, and plant parasites are
    transmitted both vertically and horizontally, and some horizontal
    transmission is generally necessary to maintain parasites at all. We
    present a population-dynamical model for the evolution of virulence when
    both vertical and horizontal transmission are present. In the simplest
    such model, up to two infectious strains can coexist within one host
    population. Virulent, vertically transmitted pathogens can persist in a
    population when they provide protection against more virulent, horizontally
    transmitted strains. When virulence is maintained by a correlation with
    horizontal transmission rates, increased levels of vertical transmission
    always lower the evolutionarily stable (ESS) level of virulence. Contrary
    to existing theory, however, increases in opportunities for horizontal
    transmission also lower the ESS level of virulence. We explain these
    findings in light of earlier work and confirm them in simulations including
    imperfect vertical transmission. We describe further simulations, in which
    both vertical and horizontal transmission rates are allowed to evolve. The
    outcome of these simulations depends on whether high levels of vertical
    transmission are possible with low virulence. Finally, we argue against the
    notion of a virulence-avirulence continuum between horizontal and vertical
    transmission, and discuss our results in relation to empirical studies of
    transmission and virulence.},

    (R0) of the parasite is shown to be a sum of horizontal and vertical
    components. We derive expressions for the equilibrium prevalence of infection
    for a mixture of horizontal and vertical transmission; prevalence can reach
    100\% if transmission is sufficiently high. At the endemic equilibrium, if
    prevalence is high, most transmission will in general be vertical, but
    horizontal transmission rates must be high to reach and stably maintain
    such an equilibrium. Surprisingly, for such parasites the highest equilibrium
    rates of vertical transmission are observed when horizontal transmission is
    very effective. We discuss the implications for assessing the importance of
    horizontal v. vertical transmission from field data, and we suggest some
    implications for the evolution of virulence.}

    pathogenesis of an animal virus in its natural host may provide insight
    into pathogenesis of a related human virus. Development of model systems
    can be difficult and expensive but modern genetic methods are providing
    new avenues of study. Often results from several different models are
