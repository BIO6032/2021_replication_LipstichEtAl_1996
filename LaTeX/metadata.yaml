abstract: "The population dynamics of vertical and horizontal transmission allow
          for the study of the evolution of virulence. Here, we replicate an
          epidemiological model by Lipsitch et al. (1996) analyzing the
          trade-offs between both types. The population dynamics between one
          host and 100 pathogen strains added individually every 1,000 timesteps
          in the presence of both mechanisms support that increased vertical
          transmission rates select for lower evolutionary stable levels of
          virulence. However, virulent vertically-transmitted pathogens can
          persist when they provide protection against even more virulent
          horizontally-transmitted strains. Furthermore, increasing horizontal
          transmission opportunities favour less virulent strains that are good
          at vertical transmission because of selection for greater host fitness.
          Finally, we present simulations allowing both transmission rates to
          evolve, and show that strains exhibiting high levels of vertical
          transmission can only be successful in contexts of low virulence."
